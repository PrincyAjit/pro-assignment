# Online Retail Shop Assignment

This application is built using ReactJS. It lists a set of available products in the store and allows the admin to add,edit,delete products with simple styling. Necessary validations have been handled.

### Libraries Used:

1.  Material UI
2.  Jest
3.  testing-library/react

**Notes:**

1.  Delete api is failing so that action will always show the generic error message in the dialog.
2.  Since the create product api does not allow same product name, the validation to enter a unique product name (basedon product names received) is added.
